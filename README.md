# React Phaser Example

This repository contains a small example combining React and Phaser.js. The player can move with the arrow keys and interacting with an NPC opens a simple dialog box.

## Running the example

Simply open `react-phaser-example/index.html` in a browser with internet access. The page loads React, ReactDOM, and Phaser from CDNs.

Edit `react-phaser-example/index.js` to change the prompt text or replace the API key if needed.

The code for the example resides in `react-phaser-example/index.js`.
